# TDAT3025 - Fall 2020
This repo contains all the exercises for the course TDAT3025 - Applied Machine Learning with Project, during the fall semester 2020.
## [Exercise 1 - Linear Recursion](/Øving-1)
This exercise uses PyTorch to train the machine on different datasets, to create a regression model corresponding to the values.
### [Task A](/Øving-1/task-a.py)
Linear 2d recursion of a dataset containing length to width values.
### [Task B](/Øving-1/task-b.py)
Linear 3d recursion of dataset using length and weight values corresponding to different days.
### [Task C](/Øving-1/task-c.py)
Non linear 2d recursion of a dataset of the head circumference of newborn babies by day, using the following predicator: f(x) = 20σ(xW + b) + 31, where σ is the sigmoid function.
